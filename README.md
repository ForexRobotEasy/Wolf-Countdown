## Indicator Code Explanation

The code for the Wolf Countdown indicator is written in MQL5, the programming language used in MetaTrader 5. Here is a brief explanation of the code:

- The `OnInit` function is called when the indicator is initialized. It returns `INIT_SUCCEEDED` to indicate a successful initialization.
- The `OnDeinit` function is called when the indicator is being deinitialized. It can be used to perform any necessary cleanup tasks.
- The `OnCalculate` function is the main function of the indicator. It is called on each tick to calculate the countdown to the closure of a trading candle. It calculates the remaining time by subtracting the current time from the time of the next candle.
- The countdown is then printed using the `Print` function.
